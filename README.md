# 👋 Hi, I'm Joel McIntosh – Founder of Altura Education

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm the creator and product designer behind **Critical Reading Journeys**, an AI-powered learning experience built to deepen comprehension and critical thinking in advanced learners in grades 3–6.

## 🚀 About the Project: Critical Reading Journeys

**Critical Reading Journeys (CRJ)** transforms reading from a passive task into a dynamic, reflective process. Designed for gifted and advanced learners, CRJ leads students through a structured dialogue that mimics Socratic questioning and inquiry-based learning. The platform uses generative AI to guide students through four progressive phases:

- **Understand**
- **Analyze**
- **Evaluate**
- **Create**

The CRJ framework is rooted in **Anderson & Krathwohl’s revised Bloom’s Taxonomy**, making it both rigorous and developmentally appropriate.

> 🧠 "We’re building a system that doesn’t just ask what the text says, but what the reader *thinks* about it—and why that matters."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (in development)

We're currently building the platform with the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express  
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore  
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth  
- **AI Integration**: Claude API (Anthropic)  
- **Hosting**: Netlify

We’re taking a lean, modular, and privacy-conscious approach to ensure performance and security—especially for our student users.

## 🤝 Who I'm Looking to Work With

I'm seeking a **full-stack web developer** with an interest in education and thoughtful product development. If you’re someone who enjoys collaborating on meaningful tools for young learners, I’d love to connect.

**Ideal collaborator profile:**

- 🔧 React + Node.js development experience
- 🌐 Comfortable with integrating AI APIs and Firebase
- 🧑‍🏫 Experience with EdTech, student-facing UIs, or compliance with **COPPA/FERPA**
- 🧩 Enjoys solving UI/UX challenges with a student-first mindset
- 💬 Can explain tech clearly to a non-developer founder
- 💡 Works well in iterative, feedback-driven cycles
